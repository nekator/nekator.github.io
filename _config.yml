    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      In the past, I have worked on a wide range of projects, from mainframe systems using Cobol and Java,
      to mobile devices using IOS and Android. 
      I have also done work on desktop software using Electron and various server-side software. 
      I have a strong background in Java and Spring, but I am also proficient in Javascript 
      and am comfortable using any tools necessary to complete a project. 
      I have experience working on projects across the entire spectrum of software development, 
      and enjoy tackling new challenges and learning new technologies.

      At my time working on ZIP I had the chance to write software running on ICE trains and also in the cloud (AWS),
      using a wide range of technologies and languages.   

      In addition, I am a father of two daughters and am married.
